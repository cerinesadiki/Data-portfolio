# Cerine Sadiki - Data Portfolio
Hi! I'm Cerine, an Astrophysics graduate passionate about data analysis and visualisation. 
During my degree, I developed strong coding skills, mainly using **Python and Excel**. 
Since my degree, I have completed the **CodeFirstGirls Data and SQL** course in order to develop my technical skills further.
I am now looking for a role to put these skills into practice and develop even further.

## Technical Skills
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy)
- SQL
- Excel
- Data visualisation

## Projects
- [Supernova Polarimetry Project](https://github.com/cerinesadiki/Supernova-Polarimetry-Analysis) - This project was completed as my final Bachelor's project. It consisted of importing hundreds of polarimetric images from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, cleaning the data by sorting through and removing effects in the images, then carrying out polarisation calculations in Python.
- [Solar Limb Darkening Project](https://github.com/cerinesadiki/Solar-Limb-Darkening-Project) - This project consists of collecting images from a telescope of the sun as it passes by the field of vision and analysing it to investigate solar limb darkening.
